# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview 
In this project I have used RStudio to show the statistical technical analysis for the following:
- Linear Regression to Predict MPG:
 - I have used the csv file [MecheCar_mgp.csv]() to create the data frame MecheCar_dataframe. I then create the coefficients values by using the 1m function to hold the residuals and coefficients values. 
- Summary Statistics on Suspension Coil
    - I have used the csv file [Suspension_Coil.csv]() to create the dataframe coilsTotal_summary which was then inturn used to create the mean, median, variance and standard deivation.
- T-Test on Suspension Coils
    - I used the Welch Two Sample t-test, where I created two sample table from the suspension table dataframe.
- Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition


## Results
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
    - In variables/coefficients in the MechaCar_dataframe, the non-random amount of variance to mpg value are the Estimate value of -1.040e02 and t value of -6.559, note both of these have extremely small p-value of 5.35e11, meaning that they had a high level of significance.

    - The slope of the linear model IS NOT considered to be zero, because 
     of Residual standard error: 8.774 on 44 degrees of freedom
    - The linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes was very effectively, because of Multiple R-squared: 0.7149,	Adjusted R-squared: 0.6825  and F-statistic: 22.07 on 5 and 44 DF,  p-value: 5.35e-11. See File [MechaCarChallenge.R]() Line 1- 11

## Summary Statistics on Suspension
    - The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils  dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Lot 3 variance was almost double the design specifications for the suspension coils (170 plus)  which cause the Standard divaiation to be much high than  Lot 1 and Lot 2. Note that Lot 1 and Lot 2 has meant all design specifications. See File [MechaCarChallenge.R]() Line 12 - 37

## T-Test on Suspension Coils
    - Welch Two Sample t-test was performed on two sample table against PSI for each manufacturing lot is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.The t = 0.989, df = 16.577, p-value = 0.3369
The alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0. 
95 percent confidence interval: -0.0005945674 for Sample 1 and  0.0016400259 for sample 2
sample estimates: mean of x is 3.175743 and the mean of y 3.175220

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition.
This statistical study compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, in findings, I found that Manufacturer of Lot 3 were poorly designed with a suspension coil variance greater than 100. Suspension coils that is greater than 100 can have an advert refect on the vehicles fuel efficiency and horse power which can result in higher maintenance cost, or safety rating.
Sample 1 and sample 2 each consisted for 10 vehicles from 150. Based on the Shapiro-Wilk test p-value approximately greater than 0.05 for normal data , our t-test p-value for the majority was 0.33 which is normal for the vehicles.The alternative hypothesis indicated that it was not equal to zero with 95 percent confidence interval: -0.0005945674 for Sample 1 and  0.0016400259 for sample 2. I use the Welch Two Sample t-test to test the hypothesis beacause it takes actual data to do the t-test samplesthe PSI is need to run the t-test.
